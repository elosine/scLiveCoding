# FreqScope and Visuals

-------

- Start a scope, make IDE transparent, now you have visuals
- Also an X/Y scope combined with some nice panning can be a really nice way to not only make music that is informed by visuals but visuals that are directly informed by music, something that i've done a bit of but haven't fully explored yet.
